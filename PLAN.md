# Detailed Plan for DataLexis App Enhancement and Introduction Page

## Overview
The goal is to create and improve the DataLexis data analysis app with a focus on performance, user experience, and achieving 99% efficiency. The app will have an introduction page before entering the main dashboard.

## Current State Summary
- Introduction page (landing.html) exists with a welcome message and link to login.
- Main dashboard (index.html) supports CSV upload, filtering, stats, and charts.
- Frontend logic (app.js) uses a web worker (dataWorker.js) for CSV parsing.
- Backend (app_part1.py to app_part4.py) handles user auth, file upload, and API endpoints.

## Planned Improvements

### Introduction Page
- Review and enhance landing.html for better UX and branding.
- Ensure smooth navigation from introduction to login and dashboard.

### Frontend (index.html, app.js, dataWorker.js)
- Optimize app.js for performance:
  - Debounce filter input events.
  - Optimize filtering and rendering logic.
  - Improve drag-and-drop responsiveness.
- Enhance dataWorker.js if needed for faster CSV parsing.
- Add loading indicators during data processing.
- Improve accessibility and responsiveness.
- Ensure theme toggle works seamlessly.

### Backend (app_part*.py)
- Optimize database queries and session management.
- Add caching where applicable.
- Implement or improve analytics endpoints.
- Ensure secure and efficient file upload and retrieval.
- Review and improve JWT token handling for performance.

### Overall
- Ensure the app is named "DataLexis" consistently.
- Target 99% efficiency by optimizing frontend and backend.
- Add error handling and user feedback for better UX.
- Update README.md with usage and performance notes.
